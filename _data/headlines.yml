#IMPORTANT: Don't forget to tab/indent two spaces for each line of text!
#
#Example:
#
#- >-
#  This is a headline which is very long and may need to be carried over onto a
#  a second or third line in this file, but in any case all lines of text should be
#  indented two spaces from the delimiter "- >-" to be recognized as a value.
