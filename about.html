    <p>The Cloverleaf Area Ecumenical Assistance Program (CAEAP, or simply the "Cloverleaf Food Bank")
       is an association of faith-based organizations in the South Hills area of Pittsburgh who are committed to
      serving families in our communities, regardless of their religious affiliation,
      who are in need of food or other forms of assistance. Our service area is centered
      symbolically around the interchange of PA Route 51 and Curry Hollow Rd. in Pleasant Hills, PA
      - a feature known locally as simply "the Cloverleaf".
    </p>
    <p>Our main service to the area is our community food pantry operating out of St. Elizabeth
      of Hungary Roman Catholic Church (1 Grove Pl., Pittsburgh, PA 15236) - our service area constitutes
      the area within a two-mile radius of the pantry. We hold
      food distribution events every other Tuesday from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM at our pantry location
      for clients in our service area. As of November 2020, CAEAP serves <strong>over 200 households</strong>
      in our service area with a team of <strong>30 volunteers</strong> who aid in food collection and
      distribution.
    </p>
    <p>In addition to food we also serve as a distribution point for the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>KDKA Thanksgiving Turkey Certificates</li>
