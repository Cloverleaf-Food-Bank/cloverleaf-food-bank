      <p>Your participation in the work of CAEAP allows you play a role in solving the problem
        of hunger in our communities, no matter how much or how little you are able to offer.
        You can contribute to our organization in the following ways

        <h4 class="card-title">Give Food</h4>
        <hr/>
        <p>We accept tax-deductible donations of non-perishable food items, such as grains and canned goods, at our
          pantry location at St. Elizabeth of Hungary Roman Catholic Church (1 Grove Pl., Pittsburgh, PA 15236).

        <h4 class="card-title">Give Time</h4>
        <hr/>
        <p>Our volunteers are the face of CAEAP to the community and they form the link between our resources
          and the members of our community who need them. We need our volunteers to run our
          food distributions on Tuesday mornings from 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM and for preparing for food distribution
          on Monday mornings. Even if you can only come once a month or less to an event, or for part of an event
          (for example, if you are only available for the first or second half of a distribution due to other commitments)
          we are open to finding a way to allow you to serve. Contact us at (412) 207-1657 to volunteer.
        </p>
